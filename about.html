		<h2>about</h2>
		<p>
			Nicholas Solem is a Computer Music Ph.D candidate at the University of California, San Diego. Recently, his research has focused on the use of artificial neural networks trained on psychoacoustical measurements to generate waveforms, which are then further harnessed in more elementary forms of synthesis, such as wavetable and granular. He is also interested in primitive, forgotten, reappropriative, and 'heretical' sound synthesis methods. He holds a Masters of Music in Music Technology from New York University and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from the College of Wooster. <br>
